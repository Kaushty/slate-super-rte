# Slate RichTextEditor with DND 
### A Rich Text Editor built using Slate framework.
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Overview
A Rich Text Editor (RTE) built using Slate.js framework. <br />
Slate.js provides ways to create a RTE without any hassles. This project adds to it by implementing a Drag and Drop feature for the texts in the editor. <br />
This project makes use of react-beautiful-dnd package to acheive this functionality.
You can simply rearrange the lines of text you added by dragging and droping it at a position you wish it to be in.

### `npm install`
